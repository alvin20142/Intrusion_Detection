Intrusion Detection

There are various types of attacks on a computer network from unauthorized users to achieve their goals. The task of this project is to build a classifier to distinguish between malicious attacks and normal behaviour. We will use feature selection on the data to narrow down the number of columns that will be needed and then we run the data through different models such as Logisitic regression, decision tree, and random forest along with GridSearchCV to find the best score and the best parameters.
